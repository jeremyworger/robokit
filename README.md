Robokit is a neural network powered AI that generates MIDI drum loops (in a hip-hop style). Written in Clojure.

  - Click a button
  - Get a MIDI file
  - Magic

Given the simple network configuration, simple data model, limited training data; it performs surprisingly well! With a little touching up these loops can serve as a creative launchpad for your percussive ideas.

### Demonstration

Here are some loops generated by robokit. They were played at 89 BPM and quantized to 16th notes in Ableton Live Lite.

 - [Example 1]
 - [Example 2]
 - [Example 3]
 - [Example 4]

### Tech

Robokit is a simple LSTM neural network with a single hidden layer. A Clojure wrapper for Deeplearning4j was used for building and training the network. Read more here: [jutsu.ai] 
The trained, serialized model is included in the `resources/model` directory.

### Training Data

The LSTM network was trained on 65 unquantized hip-hop MIDI drum loops. They are included for reference in the `resources/midi` folder. Functions related to converting the training data and training the network live in the `src/robokit/midi.clj` and `src/robokit/train.clj` namespaces.

### Usage

 A simple GUI interface is provided that allows the user to generate random hip-hop MIDI drum loops by sampling from the network.
 If you're not already comfortable with music software that can play the MIDI files, [Ableton Live Lite] will do the trick.
 Just open a drum rack in Ableton and drag the MIDI file onto the corresponding track. The MIDI notes output by robokit are already 
 mapped to the positions the drum rack expects. You should just need to press play. You may want to quantize to 16th notes
 to make it sound a little cleaner; robokit's network was trained on unquantized input.

### Installation

Robokit requires a recent Java Runtime Environment (JRE) install on your machine. After this prerequisite is met, click the 'release' link near the top of this page and download the `robokit_executable` binary. You may need to edit the file extension to get the binary to run on your platform. `.bat` should get it running on Windows, `.sh` should do it on Unix.

You can also build the binary yourself if you have the [lein] Clojure build tool installed. Clone the repository and run `lein bin` from the root directory.

### Todos
 - Expand data model to include velocity information
 - Expand training dataset
 - Experiment with a more complicated network structure on an AWS P2 instance
